Introduction to this Syllabus 

Purpose of this Document 

This syllabus forms the basis for the International Software Testing 
Qualification at the Foundation Level. The International Software Testing 
Qualifications Board (ISTQB) provides it to the National Boards for them to 
accredit the training providers and to derive examination questions in their 
local language. Training providers will determine appropriate teaching methods 
and produce courseware for accreditation.  The syllabus will help candidates 
in their preparation for the examination. Information on the history and 
background of the syllabus can be found in Appendix A. 

The Certified Tester Foundation Level in Software Testing 

The Foundation Level qualification is aimed at anyone involved in software 
testing. This includes people in roles such as testers, test analysts, 
test engineers, test consultants, test managers, user acceptance testers 
and software developers. This Foundation Level qualification is also 
appropriate for anyone who wants a basic understanding of software testing, 
such as project managers, quality managers, software development managers, 
business analysts, IT directors and management consultants. Holders of the 
Foundation Certificate will be able to go on to a higher-level software 
testing qualification.
